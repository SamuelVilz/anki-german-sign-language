This is a set of flashcards for the popular open-source spaced repetition software [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), which will teach you signs of the German Sign Language. It contains **over 4000 signs** and their meanings!

The basis for these flashcards is [SignDict](https://signdict.org), an open dictionary for sign language, developed by Bodo Tasche. Its video content originates from different sources.

## Installation

You can download the current release [from AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1439024119). Then, in Anki, use `File -> Import` and select the .apkg file.

Note: Using this Anki deck requires an Internet connection, as the videos are streamed on-demand.  Also, the video player does not seem to work on every platform: It is known to work in Anki's Android app, but not in the Linux desktop version.

## Contributing

If you find a mistake, or have other ideas on how to improve the deck, please don't hesitate to [open a new issue](https://github.com/blinry/anki-german-sign-language/issues)!

This deck is built using the [CrowdAnki](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki) add-on. Please note that, in order to import JSON-files properly, you might temporarily have to install an older version of Anki - mind the [Issues tab of CrowdAnki](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki/issues).
